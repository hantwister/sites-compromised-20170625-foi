I currently have no evidence that Orlando was compromised by Team System Dz in late June 2017.

However, I did have evidence that Orlando was interested in at least one of the DNN-related vulnerabilities in late June, and thought it reasonable to send them a sunshine request as well.

I am withholding large portions of their original response, as a substantial number of e-mails were irrelevant to my request, and two irrelevant e-mails contained PII.
